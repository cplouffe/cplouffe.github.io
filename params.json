The app aggregates data from several popular event listing sites, drawing them all on a single map so you can see what's happening where you are or where you'll be and decide whether you want to go listen to an up-and-coming band at the local pub, cheer on your favourite team, take in a show, or simply join in the fun at a community festival... And it can easily be adapted for other cities!\r\n\r\n## reac.TOR shows you WHERE\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different event listing sites - blogTO, InsideToronto, Just Shows, ... - and one thing they all have in common is that they don't map their events (or, at best, use Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to show the location of a single event). This makes it difficult for anyone unfamiliar with the city - or simply wanting to know what's happening around them - to find the events that matter to them.\r\nWith reac.TOR, you can choose to zoom to a particular region or neighbourhood in the city to see what's going on in that area.\r\n\r\n## reac.TOR is responsive\r\n\r\nDesigned for mobile devices, event clustering keeps the map from getting too cluttered at any scale and at any screen size. Simply click on a cluster to break it into smaller clusters or individual events. Colour-coded events help you quickly spot the events you're most interested in.\r\n\r\nreac.TOR will only give you the essential information - what, when, where - when you click on an event feature. Need more? Click on More Info and a secondary pop-up appears with the category, price, and description, plus a link to the original event listing.\r\n\r\n## reac.TOR puts you in control\r\n\r\nEvery day, there are dozens of different events across the city. reac.TOR's filters allow you to choose the **date**, the **price**, and the **type of event** so you only see the events you want to see. You can also choose the source to see events from.\r\n\r\n**Don't be proactive - get reactive!**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setup & Development\r\n\r\nTo run the development environment for reac.TOR, you will need:\r\n\r\n1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\r\n1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)\r\n1. [Bower](http://bower.io/)\r\n1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) (to compile SASS)\r\n\r\nInstall `node` on your system by following [these instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation#installing-without-building).\r\n\r\nOnce Node.js is installed, install the Grunt and Bower command line utilities by running `npm install -g grunt-cli` and `npm install -g bower` in your console.\r\n\r\nClone the reac.TOR repository and `cd` into its root directory.\r\n\r\nRun `npm install`, and then  `bower install` to pull down required packages and external dependencies for reac.TOR.\r\n\r\nWhen developing, run the Grunt development task to watch SASS and Handlebars files and keep CSS and HTML files current:\r\n\r\n    grunt dev\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
